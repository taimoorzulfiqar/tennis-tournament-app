# User Deletion Solution

## Current Behavior

When you delete a user from the app:

1. ✅ **Profile is deleted** from the `profiles` table
2. ✅ **User disappears from the UI** 
3. ✅ **User cannot access the app** (no profile = no access)
4. ❌ **Auth user remains** in the `auth.users` table in Supabase

## Why This Happens

The `auth.users` table in Supabase can only be modified using:
- **Service Role Key** (admin privileges)
- **Supabase Dashboard** (manual deletion)
- **Server-side functions** with admin privileges

Client-side applications cannot delete auth users for security reasons.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Manual Cleanup (Recommended)
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Users**
3. Find the deleted user by email
4. Click **Delete** to remove them completely

### Option 2: Server-Side Script (Advanced)
If you want automated deletion, you can:

1. **Get your Service Role Key** from Supabase Dashboard > Settings > API
2. **Create a server-side script** using the service role key
3. **Run the script** to delete auth users

### Option 3: Database Function
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create a function to mark users as deleted
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mark_user_deleted(user_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE profiles 
  SET deleted_at = NOW(), 
      is_active = FALSE 
  WHERE id = user_id;
  RETURN TRUE;
EXCEPTION
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RETURN FALSE;
END;
$$;
```

## Current Implementation

The current implementation:
- ✅ **Prevents user access** to the app
- ✅ **Removes user from all lists**
- ✅ **Maintains data integrity**
- ❌ **Leaves auth user in Supabase**

This is actually a **safe approach** because:
1. Users cannot log in without a profile
2. All app functionality is blocked
3. Data integrity is maintained
4. You can manually clean up auth users later

## Recommendation

**Keep the current implementation** and manually delete auth users from the Supabase Dashboard when needed. This is the most secure and practical approach for a client-side application.
